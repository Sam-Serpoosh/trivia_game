## Legacy Coderetreat

## Trivia Game:

This code is based on [@jbrains](https://twitter.com/jbrains) legacy coderetreat which you can find [here](https://github.com/jbrains/trivia).

I tried it for deliberate practicing and fun! It was so much fun and there are a lot of challenging items in this exercise which makes you to think hardly about what should be the next step and what action is critical at each moment!

I strongly recommend you to do it yourself and also any kind of feedback on this, is more than welcome as usual! (It is not done yet BTW!)
